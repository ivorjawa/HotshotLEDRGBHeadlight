# Hotshot LED RGB Headlight
WS2812B RGB LED headlamp holder for Tamaya Hotshot and similar RC cars.  I've included both STL files so the parts can be directly printed, and STEP files for those wanting to modify the light.  The sheet metal files in DXF and SVG can be used to cut foil tape to make the reflectors with a cutter such a a Cricut.
